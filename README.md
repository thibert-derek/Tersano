### Tersano Challenge

Welsome to my project!
This project was requested by Tersano Inc. as part of a hiring process. This project is a simple full stack application with React as the frontend and TypeScript using Express as the backend.

## How to Run The Project
Pull this project from Github (Obviously, haha)
There are two folders: backend and frontend;
Use two seperate terminals, change directory to each and use "npm start". This will run both the servers.

Once, then you should encounter a Register page where you can input your username, email, password for the first time.
If succeeded, you will be sent to the login page to login.
You will then see the main products page, where users can view, add, and delete products.

If you look at the Console as you inspect the browser and check the Response, you will see JSON messages that displays messages such as "User already exists" if a registration attempt failed
due to an already registered user, hence, you can just login.

I want to thank Tersano for giving me the chance to work on this project. It also helped me learn more about setting up a full stack web application.

Enjoy!
